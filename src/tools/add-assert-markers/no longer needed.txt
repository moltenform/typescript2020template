No need for assert tags:

1) tell vite to produce source maps in production
2) console.log out the stack trace... might be good to json.stringify it first in case chrome tries to do some mapping on its own
3) go to https://sourcemap.tools/ and see the real stack trace

for each prod upload we should keep the stack trace and the source code around.
